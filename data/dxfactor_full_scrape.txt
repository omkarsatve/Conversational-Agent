Building theDigital Advantage
Outcome driven technology and data solutions for forward-thinking organizations.
The Emergence of TheOutcome Economy
We live in a new world that is increasingly connected and quantified than ever before, leading to the rise of the outcome economy. Companies are beginning to shift their focus from selling products and services to delivering end results that they produce. To provide quantifiable outcomes, companies require a deeper understanding of customer needs and contexts in which products and services are used. Also, value creation on output requires quantifying results in real-time. Both of these requirements have been nearly impossible to tackle, until now.
DXFactor takes on the complexity of business problems and simplifies them into measurable, tangible outcomes that drive transformational change across an enterprise.
Guaranteed outcomes
We are super obsessed about outcomes. We go beyond just successfully completing the project. Every project we work on is guaranteed to generate real value.

A Next Generation Data Solution Delivers $750,000 Savings in Infrastructure and Reconciliation Costs
About the Client
Created a Digital Inspection Platform for ARInspect that offers a robust suite of technology solutions that combine out-of-the-box features with flexible configuration options to make the most advanced testing kit for insights, inspections, assessments, and enforcement.
The Challenge
Based on DXFactor and ARInspect team’s collaborative research of the United States’ inspection market:
What We Did
The Solution
DXFactor, with its proven expertise in product development, artificial intelligence, and data science, helped ARInspect build the most complex and meaningful compliance inspection platforms available today in the market in a matter of three months.
Below are the specific features developed to meet compliance, monitoring, and enforcement needs.
Real-Time Data Access– Developed a mobile application for inspectors to have full access to case files in real-time in the field to avoid audit delays. The app maximizes the inspector’s time in the field by eliminating all previously done tasks – for example, taking pictures or measuring areas, etc.
Risk Identification and Prioritization– We cross-pollinated inspection agencies’ data with a unique mixture of external data and passed it to Machine Learning models for risk-based priority scoring so managers can prioritize and schedule inspections based on risk scores.
Scheduling Flexibility– A cloud-based web portal enables administrators, managers, and supervisors to plan assignments, adjust schedule changes, run reports, and perform inspection reviews.
Process Automation– Automated the process of creating inspection reports and enforcement documents. Moreover, inspectors can share reports and recommendations with audited entities to clear up any misunderstandings from past inspections.
Direct Line for Citizens– With the regulated citizens portal facility, owners can see all of their previous inspections and enforcement actions along with following up on their compliance issues. The communication portal becomes a single point of communication between inspectors and citizens, eliminating the burden of emails, paper correspondences, voicemails, etc.
Results & Outcomes
State-of-the-art inspection platform combines out-of-the-box features with flexible configuration options for different compliance use cases to create the most advanced platform for government enforcement and inspections.
increase in discovering high-risk violators with the cross-pollination of data.
increase in workers in field time by automating pre and post-inspection processes.
improvement in tracking lost revenue thanks to increased inspection rate.

9.1 Changes.These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Site.  You are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address.  In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice.  Continued use of our Site following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
9.2 Dispute Resolution.Please read this Section 9.2 (sometimes referred to herein as this “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
(a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with these Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under these Terms
(b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 4205 Ridge Top Road, Fairfax, Virginia 22030.  After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.
(c) Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.  Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.  JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(d) Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and these Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
(e) Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Company are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 9.2(a) (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement) above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would.  However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
(f) Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of Virginia.  All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.
(g) 30-Day Right to Opt Out.You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: inquiry@dxfactor.com, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, your Company username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Company account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
(h) Severability.Except as provided in Section 9.2(f) (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
(i) Survival of Agreement.This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.
(j) Modification.Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if Company makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing Company at the following address: inquiry@dxfactor.com.
9.3 Export.The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.
9.4 Disclosures.Company is located at the address in Section 9.8. If you are a California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.
9.5 Electronic Communications.The communications between you and Company use electronic means, whether you use the Site or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Site or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.
9.6 Entire Terms.These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.  These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.  Company may freely assign these Terms.  The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.
